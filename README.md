This repository contains code snippets and notebooks for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project conducted on the Football players data.
The analysis was completed as part of the data science course on Entri Elevate

Key Steps and Visualizations

1. Data Loading and Cleaning:
   - Loaded the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
   - Conducted data cleaning and imputation, handling missing values.

2. Grouping and Aggregation:
   - Used the `groupby` function to group data by specific columns.
   - Demonstrated aggregation operations, such as finding the maximum salary for each team and position.

3. Correlation Analysis:
   - Explored the correlation between age and salary.

4. Visualizations:
   - Utilized scatter plots with a regression line, to visually represent data relationships.
   - Showcased the highest salary for each team and position.

Conclusion:
- Concluded the EDA process with a comprehensive understanding of the dataset's structure, relationships, and patterns.
- Provided insights that can inform subsequent analyses or modeling tasks.
